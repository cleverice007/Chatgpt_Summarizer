Ben and Doug discuss the pronunciation of Porsche and the story behind the iconic brand. Doug explains that the German accent of the word is "por-shuh" and Ben introduces the podcast Acquired, which tells the story of Porsche.
This episode of Ben and David's podcast tells the story of Porsche, a European luxury brand known for its balance between building supercars and being a great daily driver. It explores how Porsche has cultivated a vibrant community of wealthy people, and how it has managed to maintain pricing power while producing 350,000 cars a year.
This story follows the history of Porsche, from its beginnings with Nazis and tanks, to its misadventures in the 1980s, to its current status as a luxury brand. Doug DeMuro, a YouTuber and former Porsche corporate employee, is featured as a partner in crime to help tell the story.
Doug is an enthusiast of the Porsche brand and is being interviewed in front of his Carrera GT. This episode of Acquired is not investment advice, but David and Doug may have investments in the companies discussed.
David and Doug discuss the long and incredible history of science and engineering in Germany and Austria, which dates back to the scientific revolution and Johannes Kepler, and how Germany had produced more Nobel laureates in scientific fields than any other nation in the world before World War II.
Germany has produced many Nobel laureates in scientific fields, such as Max Planck, Erwin Schrodinger, Kurt Godel, and Albert Einstein. Siegfried Marcus, a German inventor, is likely to have created the first gas-powered transportation vehicle in 1864. Germany also created the first successful production consumer automobile, the Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
The Invention of the Benz Patent-Motorwagen and the Mercedes Model by Carl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler in the 1800s. German inventors Carl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler created the first successful production consumer automobile, the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, in 1885. Daimler's company later produced a popular model in the early 1900s, named after the daughter of one of their biggest dealers.
In 1924, Benz and Daimler merged to form Mercedes-Benz, and in 1906, Daimler recruited Ferdinand Porsche, the Potting prize winner, to be their Chief Engineer. Porsche was given an honorary degree later in life, but never finished college.
Ferdinand Porsche was a renowned engineer and a close associate of Adolf Hitler, having been a member of the SS. Despite his Nazi affiliations, Porsche was honored with an honorary doctorate for his engineering accomplishments.
Ferdinand Porsche, a Potting prize winner from Austria, moved his family to Stuttgart, Germany, to become the head of engineering at Daimler. Despite his business and engineering contributions, it is important to remember that he was a real big Nazi.
Stuttgart is known as the Detroit of the German auto industry, with Mercedes-Benz and Porsche based there, as well as many suppliers and subcontractors. Everyone in Stuttgart is connected to the automotive industry in some way, and Porsche has been a major part of the city for a long time.
arket Automobile 
The Model T was a large car like a modern small automobile that was accessible to the average German in the 1930s, when only 2% of Germans owned a car compared to 30% of Americans. This posed a challenge to Daimler Benz to build a car that was affordable enough for the average German to buy.
The board of Daimler Benz rejected Ferdinand Porsche's idea, leading to a huge fight and his eventual departure from the company in 1929. Despite the rivalry, the two companies still share the same town and have been known to have beers together.
In 1931, Ferdinand Porsche started a consulting firm to advise other car companies on their designs and even design cars for them. The firm was named The Dr. Ing. h. c. Ferdinand Porsche Consulting and Design Services for Motor Vehicles company.
Ferdinand Porsche founded the Dr. Ing. h.c. Ferdinand Porsche Consulting and Design Services for Motor Vehicles company in the early 1900s, with financial support from his son-in-law Anton Piech and Adolf Rosenberger.
Anton Piech and Adolf Rosenberger were the founders of Porsche, but when Rosenberger was arrested by the Gestapo and written out of history, Piech was left to continue the company's success with a contract to design the Volkswagen.
Adolf Hitler was the founder of Volkswagen, the company that contracted Porsche to design the Volkswagen Beetle, an affordable car for the people.
Mark Zuckerberg's association with Facebook is discussed, as well as the Nazi connections of Volkswagen and Porsche. It is noted that the companies are now run by different people, and Volkswagen was refounded after the war.
After World War II, Volkswagen was refounded by Adolf Hitler and went on to become the most popular car in the world. It was produced in many countries over many years and its effect is still seen today.
The original Beetle is likely the single longest-produced and largest both in terms of length of time and number of units produced of a single generation model of car. The Beetle was the same car until the New Beetle in 1990, and today it is seen as a classic car.
The Volkswagen Beetle was created by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, who established a new city in Germany called the City of the Strength Through Joy Car to house the company. The city, Wolfsburg, is still the home of Volkswagen today.
Hitler created the city of Wolfsburg and the car conglomerate Volkswagen Group, which is now one of the largest car conglomerates in the world. Volkswagen began production of the Beetle before World War II, but production was repurposed to making military vehicles when the war began.
After WWII, Volkswagen and Porsche operations were repurposed to making military vehicles, and the companies were fractured and separated for the rest of the century. Ben and David discuss the current whereabouts of the companies, which are now one again.
WII Survival 
ar Fate 
Major Ivan Hirst was the only person to recognize the potential of the pre-war Volkswagen Beetle in the British car industry, despite the government's lack of vision for the model. He drove one of the 200 Beetles made and saw the potential for success, leading to a legendary figure in Volkswagen history.
After World War II, a man saw the need for economic revitalization in West Germany and proposed to the British command to leave the factory in Wolfsburg and place an initial seed order of 20,000 Beetles for the British military to use as their main transport.
After World War II, the British military adopted the Volkswagen Beetle as their main military transport, leading to the rise of the Volkswagen company. Ivan Hirst, an Englishman, was responsible for the initial seed order of 20,000 Beetles, which kickstarted the company. The Beetle was also popular in other European countries, as it provided a means of transportation for people to get back to work.
After World War II, European countries needed a small and cheap car to remobilize their citizens. Each country developed their own car, such as the UK's Mini, Italy's Fiat 500, and France's Citroen 2CV, all of which were based on the Beetle, which became a global hit in Germany.
David, Doug, and Ben discuss the Volkswagen Beetle, a car that was first made in 1940 and continued to be produced until 1998. They note the importance of the car in helping the Germans and French get back to work after World War II.
Ferdinand Porsche was a renowned designer who created the Beetle, the Elephant anti-tank tank, and some of the first hybrid and electric cars in history during and after the war. However, battery technology was not advanced enough to make these cars viable for production.
Ferdinand Porsche and his son
David Porsche, son of Ferdinand Porsche, was arrested for war crimes at the end of World War II and released after six months. He and his sister Louise returned to their family's ancestral home in Austria to rebuild the business.
During WWII, Porsche moved 20 of their best engineers and production people out of Stuttgart to a sawmill in Gmund, Austria, to avoid Allied bombers. They operated out of the sawmill in the farming village, with a population of a few thousand people.
Karl Ludvigsen's "Excellence Was Expected" and the Visual History of the 911 - Karl Ludvigsen's book "Excellence Was Expected" is a comprehensive history of Porsche, with incredible photos and archive work. Ben reads a coffee table book on the 911, and both discuss the tangible quality of these books and the research they provide.
Ferry and Louise return to Austria and start a new company to fix up old military vehicles, similar to how Sony started in Tokyo by fixing radios.
Ferry Porsche had a vision for a small car for the masses, but he had one major problem with the Beetle - it was slow and not fun to drive.
Ferdinand Porsche had a vision to create a sports car that was lighter and had more horsepower than the Beetle, which he drove during the war with a supercharged engine. This concept was revolutionary for the time, as sports cars were not yet a popular concept.
This text discusses the concept of creating affordable sports cars, which was a revolutionary idea in the era of brass cars and motor racing. It was a concept taken up by Porsche and refined by others, with research showing that pre-Porsche cars were often Franken-cars.
David and Doug discuss the design of sports cars from before Porsche, which were large and unwieldy due to their focus on power and speed. Despite this, modern cars such as the Carrera GT are much smaller.
Supercharging a car engine is a process that pushes in more air to create more power for the engine, allowing it to run more efficiently.
Supercharging and Turbocharging are methods of forcing more air into an engine to create more power. Turbochargers spin something to add even more air, resulting in more power being produced.
Ferry Porsche had the idea of creating a Beetle with a turbocharger, which would result in more power and faster spinning. Pros and cons of this idea were discussed.
The Porsche 356 was created by taking parts from the Beetle, a military vehicle used by Germany during the war, and combining them with a rear-mounted air-cooled engine. This process resulted in a car that is now worth up to $300,000 at auction, compared to the Beetle's $10,000-$15,000.
The desirability of the Porsche 356 is largely due to its production numbers and its place in history as a touchstone moment of the sports car coming out of the war. Despite not being affordable, a decent number of them were made, making them relatively cheap.
The Porsche 356 was not affordable in the late 1940s, but eventually became relatively cheap. It was a popular used Porsche in the 1960s and 70s, and is now revered as a major moment in Porsche history.
Despite the economic hardship of war-torn Europe in the late 1940s, there was still a market for luxury sports cars priced at the equivalent of $3750, which is around $42,000 today. Initially, sales were slow, but as people in Germany began to have more money, the demand for these cars increased.
After World War II, optimism and money in Germany led to the sports car industry taking off, with MG, Austin-Healey, and Jaguar all releasing cars that could be enjoyed and driven by the public.
Ferdinand Porsche and Anton Piech's return to Austria in 1947 marked the beginning of a new era of automobile production, with the introduction of the 356 in Gmund and Volkswagen's Beetle for Germany and the world.
ar Business Expansion 
Volkswagen proposes to reinstate the German Porsche company to do technical design and consulting work in exchange for a royalty on every Beetle sold worldwide, while also asking the Austrian Porsche company to distribute Volkswagens.
A deal between two companies involves Volkswagen distributing their cars in Austria, with the German government providing a meaningful cash flow and source of royalty to the Porsche family.
A Huge Business Opportunity - Porsche's Austrian operations become a huge business in the early 2000s, becoming the largest car dealer network in Europe with billions of annual revenue. Doug sees this as an opportunity to capitalize on the growing car industry.
Louise and her children turned a dealership network into the largest car dealer network in Europe, with exclusive distribution rights to Volkswagens and operations in multiple countries.
The value chain for selling cars in the US was historically separated between the dealership and the manufacturer, with no direct
Volkswagen was reconstituted as a company with shareholders from the German government, and later went public in 1960 or 1961. They needed third parties to operate in other countries in Europe.
Tiny is a public company that has built and acquired a collection of internet businesses, ranging from small to large deals of up to 100-plus million. They started 10-15 years ago and are now the buyer of choice for internet businesses of any size.
Tiny has always been a great destination for bootstrapped and founder-led businesses, and now they have the scale to work with venture firms too. Tiny's success is attributed to their reinvestment of positive cash flows in attractive investment opportunities, both internally and externally.
Ben and David discuss the importance of reinvesting positive cash flows in attractive investment opportunities to grow and compound a business. They suggest reaching out to Tiny with a note mentioning Ben and David, and following Andrew Wilkinson on Twitter for great content.
The West German post-Nazi government is giving a lucrative deal to former Nazis, which includes paying them for all cars made regardless of whether they distribute it or not. This deal is made to counter the Iron Curtain and the Soviets.
The Marshall Plan was implemented to help the West German industrial base recover from the effects of World War II and to prepare for the Cold War against the Soviet Union. Despite the fact that many of the industrialists had been Nazis, the West was willing to overlook this in order to strengthen their position against the Soviets.
West Germany created a tax incentive system for industrialists after World War II, with a low tax rate for ordinary people and a marginal tax rate of 95% for those above a certain income. This system allowed companies such as Porsche and Mercedes-Benz to be restarted and reinjected with steroids, as an existential threat was present next door. The license given to these companies was to create enterprise value, not to print money.
In Germany, high marginal tax rates are set for those with a certain income, with the rate at 95%. This is to incentivize capital reinvestment in the industrial space, and people are complaining about the high rate.
Corporations are incentivized to reinvest profits into industrial production, research and development, and new models, rather than paying taxes, in order to increase their brand's success.
Porsche has invested in race cars and racing over the years, with the line between consumer enthusiast car market and professional racing market being very blurry in the late 40s and early 50s. Porsche would make special versions of cars for racing, such as for Le Mans, but there is no connection between these cars and those available in dealerships.
Porsche created special versions of cars for racing, such as the 550 Spyder, which was driven by famous Hollywood actors like James Dean and Steve McQueen. These cars are now worth millions of dollars, and only 90 of them were made.
Porsche's 550 Spyder was a car that could be purchased by anyone, and was designed for racing. It has since become a legend, with some models selling for millions of dollars today. This car was a bifurcation between what anyone could do and what the best of the world could do.

Porsche's success at Le Mans was unique in that they allowed people to buy cars off the street and modify them to compete in engine classes, unlike Ferrari who had more expensive cars.
Porsche was focused on road cars, while Enzo Ferrari only wanted to race and sold road cars to finance his racing. The Ferraris were more expensive than the Porsche 356s, and many of the road cars were based on or former race cars.
Ferry Porsche's quote about his car design, which could go from an East African Safari to Le Mans, the theater, and the streets of New York, is still true today and remains Porsche's unique thing.
Porsche is a luxury brand that stands out for its ability to be used in any setting, from work to the racetrack. It is compared to a Rolex watch, which is bought to be worn, not kept in a case.
Luxury items such as watches and suitcases are made to be used, not just kept in a case and admired. They are made of durable materials such as stainless steel, and are not as expensive as items such as Louis Vuitton trunks. Brands like these are still valuable, however, as they are made to be used and can withstand wear and tear.
Porsche 550 Spyders are a type of supercar that have a breadth and depth of features, allowing them to do many things. They are considered to be a middle of the road car, as they are not as expensive as a Birkin bag, but still have the capability to go 200 miles an hour.
Le Mans is a 24-hour car race that tests the endurance and capabilities of a car and its manufacturer. It is a serious event that is used to prove technology.
Porsche's ability to win or win their class at the Le Mans race is a testament to their car's capabilities and the manufacturer's endurance over time. The race is a road race, not on a racetrack, and fuel efficiency is a factor.
Porsche's success in the US was unexpected, with 40% of their production in 1954 being sold in the US. This was due to the popularity of James Dean and Steve McQueen, and the fact that the cars were used in road races in the French countryside.
Porsche sold 588 cars in the US in 1954, which was 40% of their total production for the year. This percentage remained relatively constant and even increased in the 70s and 80s, demonstrating the importance of the American market for Porsche.
Despite the significant number of sports car startups in Europe at the time, Porsche was able to stand out and grow to become the successful company it is today. David attributes this success to the incredible performance of the cars.
The company's success was due to the popularity of their cars, royalties from the Beetle, and reinvestment in racing and international markets.
In the 1960s, the Porsche 356 was a leader in the sports car market, with other cars such as the Ford Mustang, Jaguar E-Type, and Chevrolet Stingray following suit.
In the 1960s, Ford announced the Mustang, Jaguar released the E type, and Chevy released the second generation Corvette Stingray. Porsche made the decision to invest profits into a new model, a sedan for a larger model, which would become the second model of Porsche.
Porsche's second model, a larger sedan, was cancelled due to a variety of reasons, including government influence and competition from Mercedes and BMW. The project was led by Ferdinand Porsche, the founder's grandson.
Porsche's decision to focus on sports cars was likely motivated by a cabal of Mercedes and BMW, as well as the arrival of two young Turks, Ferdinand Porsche and Ferdinand Piech, who was a brilliant engine designer.
Ferdinand Porsche's six
Peugeot trademarked the name "911" for their cars in France, using the Roman numeral X0X format. Porsche was unable to sell in France without using the trademarked name, leading to the 911 becoming a famous model.
The story behind the origin of the 911 emergency number is explored, with details from the book "Excellence Was Expected" providing insight into why the 901 was initially chosen.
An exploration of the engineering projects undertaken by Porsche between 356 and 901, including the origin of the project numbers and the reason for their seemingly random order.
Ben and David discuss the lore of Porsche car designs and model numbers, and how they are often redesigned over time.
Understanding the Different Versions - Doug and Ben discuss the different versions of the Porsche 911 and how to distinguish them from one another.
A discussion on the success of Porsche's iconic design, which has remained unchanged since 1962, and the language associated with the brand.
Porsche's 911 model was an immediate hit when it was released in 1964, selling 13,000 cars in 1966, 15% more than their best year with the 356 model. Doug explains what makes the 911 so special.
The Porsche 911 has become a symbol of sports cars due to its combination of reliability, comfort, and practicality. It has become the go-to car when people think of sports cars, and it was clear early on that Porsche had something special with the 911.
The Porsche 911 is a reliable, comfortable, and practical car that stands out from other cars due to its unique flat-six boxer engine, designed by Ferdinand Piech. This engine is a performance engine, rear-mounted, and is different from the 356's boxer four engine, which is an inline engine or a V engine.
The boxer engine is a type of engine where the cylinders are across from each other, creating a flat engine. This engine has great balance and was popular in police cars, even as V8s and V12s became more popular.
Police cars have traditionally used six cylinders, even as V8s and V12s became more popular, due to their light weight and simplicity. David and Doug discuss how the six cylinders of the 911 elevate the 356, allowing for more to be achieved than with the four cylinders of the 356.
Porsche introduced the 911 with a 50% higher price than the 356, creating a major price gap. To fill this gap, Porsche introduced the 912, a 911 with the old 356 four-cylinder engine, as an entry-level model.
Porsche's 912 model was created as a stopgap solution to provide an entry-level model to the 911, with the old 356 four-cylinder engine. Selling three quarters of the units, the 912s were cheaper and had lower profit margins than the 911s. To create a new model, Porsche eventually introduced the Boxster 20 years later.
In 1967, Porsche and Volkswagen began a joint project to produce a mid-engined roadster, eventually leading to the creation of the 914. The car was to be smaller and more compact than the 911, and would be available in both four- and six-cylinder versions. The project took several years to reach its perfect end state.
Ferry Porsche puts his nephew, Ferdinand Piech, in charge of a joint project between Volkswagen and Porsche to create the 914, a not rear-engined car with both four-cylinder and six-cylinder versions. A change in Volkswagen's CEO leads to a deepening of the relationship between Porsche and Ferdinand, and the continuation of the project, but with the four-cylinder version being a Volkswagen and the six-cylinder version a Porsche.
Volkswagen and Porsche collaborated to develop the 914 sports car, with Volkswagen receiving the four-cylinder version and Porsche receiving the more powerful 914/6. The new Volkswagen CEO was able to deepen the relationship with Ferdinand Porsche through this project.
Volkswagen and Porsche have entered a partnership in which VW takes over Porsche's distribution in America in exchange for Porsche creating a product for VW. The partnership is a massive intertwining of the two companies, with the potential to create a car that VW expects to sell more of than any other.
Porsche and Volkswagen merge to create a larger car market in America, with the 914 model being a huge success and selling more units than the 911.
Porsche's 914 model was an entry-level car that sold 100,000 units in 8 years, revolutionizing the car world with its mid-engine design. This design was seen as the perfect balance, as it was different from Porsche's previous rear-engine models.
Doug and Ben discuss the benefits of mid-engined sports cars, such as improved weight distribution and balance, and how Porsche has been able to make this design work. Ben clarifies that mid-engined cars have the engine behind the passenger seats but in front of the rear axle.
Doug and his friends discuss the advantages of mid-engined cars, with Doug claiming that the Cayman GT4 RS is the best modern Porsche. Despite Ben's disagreement, Doug insists that every car is the best when it first comes out, only to be superseded by the next best.
Doug and David discuss the importance of SEO in the YouTube world and the changes that come with electric performance cars, such as the merging of VW and Porsche.
Porsche's 911 sales remained resilient during the 1970s oil crisis, while the 914 model became a money loser for the company.
The 914 was a successful car and project for Porsche, but it created a lot of tension in the company due to its money-losing nature. This backdrop of stress was further compounded by the emergence of two Ferdinand grandsons vying for control of the company. On one side was Butzi Ferdinand Porsche, Ferry's son and a great designer, and on the other was German Ferdinand, hired by the German company.
The story of Ferdinand Porsche, son of Louise and Anton, who rose to success as an engineer executive in charge of the 914 project with Volkswagen, and eventually took control of the company.
In the fall of 1970, Ferry and Louise called a joint family summit to settle tensions between their respective companies. They had no acrimony between them, as they were brother and sister, and both were making a lot of money.
Two siblings, Louise and Ferry, make a surprising decision to jointly exit operating their family business, while still owning it, instead of one taking over.
Ferdinand's family will no longer manage, operate, design, or make product decisions for their company, which is deemed insane by Ben. He wonders what logic was used to come to this conclusion.
Ferry admits that there was probably a better solution to reuniting his family, but the outcome was still positive as tensions were eased and they could attend each other's birthdays again.
Ferdinand Piech was dismissed from the family business he had built up with his family, despite it being successful. His dismissal caused him to be angry and he went on to found Porsche Design, which produces Porsche sunglasses.
Butzi Porsche founded Porsche Design, a company that produces Porsche-branded items such as sunglasses and laptops. This company was later reabsorbed into the Porsche conglomerate, similar to the Gucci family's experience with Adam Driver's movie.
Ferdinand Piech, a talented family member, is trading on the name of his grandfather to make money through brand licensing. He is also known for designing the 911 and consulting for other car companies.
Ferdinand Piech was recruited to take over Audi for Volkswagen, and quickly became the head of the Audi brand. Volkswagen Group owned Volkswagen and Audi at the time.
Audi was once viewed as a second or third tier brand, similar to Saab, but has since become a legitimate competitor of Mercedes and BMW. David compares it to today's luxury brands such as Infinity and Kia/Hyundai, which are attempting to enter the luxury market.
Doug, David, and Ben discuss the Audi 5000 and the scandal it caused in the United States due to reports of unintended acceleration, which were later found to be unfounded. They also discuss how Volkswagen and BMW were doing well in the market, and how Audi needed to turn around. They mention how Porsche's former CEO, Piech, was forced out and how it was a mistake.
Ferdinand Piech was forced out of Porsche in 1993, but he quickly turned around Audi and was promoted to CEO of Volkswagen. He oversaw the launch of the new Beetle, and remained chairman until 2015-2016.
Ferdinand Piech was the chairman of Volkswagen from 1993 to 2016, and developed a reputation of being an iron
Ferdinand Piech, the former CEO of Volkswagen, was awarded the Car Executive of the Century award in 1999 by the Global Automotive Elections Foundation for his accomplishments in the automotive industry, such as buying Lamborghini and repurchasing the rights to the Bugatti name.
Ferdinand Piech is widely known for his impact on the car world, having been kicked out of his own company and then running a much bigger one that competes with it. He is credited with growing the company even bigger.
Ernst Fuhrmann, the first non
The Porsche 924 was a joint project between VW and Porsche, and while it was not a 911, it was still a good car to drive. Despite the stigma of being a Volkswagen, the 924 was accepted as an entry Porsche of the time and was praised for its driving capabilities.
The 924 Porsche was a different model than the 911 or 914, and was aimed at those who couldn't afford a 911 or weren't looking for its performance. It was positioned differently than the 914, and was described as a small, lightweight, compact roadster with a removable top.
CEO Fuhrmann makes a decision to replace the 911 in the 70s due to the oil crisis, safety regulations, and post-Ralph Nader's Unsafe at Any Speeds. Doug and David agree that this is for the poor customers and not a Porsche.
This post discusses the impact of the federal report Unsafe at Any Speed and the oil crisis on car safety regulations in the 1960s and 70s. It highlights how regulations such as those on bumpers, safety, and seatbelts were beneficial, but were seen as a hindrance to the fun of driving. The post also notes the drastic improvement in car safety since then.
Ben, Doug, and David discuss the evolution of automobiles, from the smaller Porsches of the past to the larger, faster, and more efficient cars of today. They also discuss the Porsche 928, which was intended to replace the 911, but still remains in production due to high demand.
Doug defends the 928 model, noting that the 356 model was replaced in the past and the 911 could be replaced in the future if demand for the 928 is high enough.
Porsche's 911 and 928 models were created in response to the oil crisis and tightening emissions laws of the time, which made it difficult to make power from anything other than a big engine. The 928 was a front engine V8 car, which Porsche had never pursued before, and was more of an American thing.
The oil crisis and tightening emissions laws in the 1970s made it difficult to make power from anything other than a big engine, and even then the power output was low. The Jaguar E-Type had been replaced by the XJS, a V8 car with an automatic transmission, which was the main competitor in the sports car market.
In the 1980s, Porsche moved away from the 911 sports car to the 928, a V8 luxury cruiser, as the economy improved and people had more disposable income.
During the 1980s, Porsche experienced a rising tide of success due to the disposable income of Wall Street and the popularity of fast cars. The Porsche and Piech families owned the business and eventually ousted CEO Fuhrmann, replacing him with American CEO Peter Schutz who redrew the 911 production line.
Porsche's 928 model threatened to replace the beloved 911 production line, causing a decrease in morale among employees and executives alike. Doug shares his experience of the legendary story of how the 911 production line was redrawn and saved.
The Porsche 911 was set to be replaced by the 928, causing low morale in the Stuttgart factory. Peter Schutz, the American CEO, and Helmuth Bott, the Chief of Engineering, discussed the timeline of the car's cancellation on a whiteboard.
In German culture, when a decision has been made, it is final. In this case, the company wanted to keep the old 911, but Schutz stood up and decided to replace it with the 928, a V8 front engine car. Morale was low, but Schutz's edict was the final decision.
Peter Schutz, the American CEO of Porsche, boosts morale by drawing a line on the wall to extend the timeline of the 911 indefinitely. Despite some debate about whether this actually happened, it is seen as a legendary moment in Porsche's history.
Doug, a former Porsche employee, recounts the story of Peter Schutz, the former Porsche CEO, who drew a line to boost his reputation among the workers. Doug later confirms the story with Porsche's general counsel in North America, who was a neighbor of Schutz in Naples, Florida.
A conversation between Doug Schutz, Ben, and David reveals that the famous story of Helmuth Bott extending the life of a production line on to the wall is true. Doug Schutz, the protagonist of the story, confirms that it really happened and that Helmuth Bott was grinning when the line was drawn. The story is a great example of how people can be creative and resourceful in difficult situations.
Porsche extended the life of their production line in the 1980s, making the 928 until 1995, and committing resources to refreshing the 911, which they had planned on ending. David mentions the go-go years of the early- to mid-80s, and the economic realities of the situation.
David and Ben discuss the success of the go-go years of the early- to mid-80s, when companies like Porsche sold a lot of cars, and how the same concept is being applied to the tech of 2021, such as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). They also mention how other European luxury brands have done Initial Public Offerings (IPOs).
European luxury brands, such as LVMH, sold a 30% stake in their companies with non-voting shares in an attempt to protect themselves from corporate raiders. This strategy was successful until 1987 when Long Term Capital Management caused the stock to double within the first year of being on the market.
Porsche's stock doubled in the first year on the market, but the end of the go-go years of the 80s was not good for the luxury sports car company. The oil crisis of the 70s had already been bad for Porsche, and the 914, 928, and 944 models all started to suffer. With three aged products, the situation was not good.
Despite the economy slowing and the cars being uncompetitive, Schutz continued production of three lines and even refreshed the 924-944 line to the 968. He reinvested resources in the car, but the exchange rates with European currencies were hit hard, making it cheaper to buy an equivalent entry level sports car from a Japanese manufacturer.
During Japan's economic boom in the 1990s, it became much cheaper to buy an entry level sports car from a Japanese manufacturer, with prices dropping from $10,000 to $20,000. This led to the rise of cars such as the Nissan 300ZX and Toyota Supra, which offered great value for money with their powerful engines.
In the 90s, Japanese cars such as the Supra were becoming increasingly popular due to their value proposition of big power for not as much money. This posed a threat to other cars such as the 944 and 968, which were no longer as popular. The 911 was not threatened, but the 928 was already old by this point. The 911 was the 964/911 by this point, making the market even more confusing.
Porsche's confusing naming system of the 964/911, 928, and other number nine cars was a complete disaster, with the 911s all saying Carrera on the back, leaving many confused.
Ben, Doug, and David discuss the history of Porsche's Carrera models, which have changed over the years. They also mention that Porsche became a public company and floated 30% of its stock, causing the stock price to decline.
Porsche's stock price declined rapidly after becoming a public company, with its market cap dropping to less than €400 million and no debt.
30 Years Ago Porsche was in Dire Straits, with US Sales Figures Dipping to 4100 Units in 1991 and 1992, Worse than 1965 Sales.
In the early 1990s, automobile sales in the US dropped to 4100 units, a level worse than 1965 sales. This caused many to believe that the company would have to be bought out, and the families would accept some value for their stake rather than have it go to zero.
Schutz gets fired in 1987, and the company cycles through three or four more CEOs over the next six years. However, there is a bright spot in the form of the 959, a supercar released at the time.
Porsche's first supercar, the 959, was not commercially successful but was a testbed for new technology such as four wheel drive. After the 959, Porsche was so desperate that they took on projects for other manufacturers, such as the Mercedes-Benz 500 E.

Audi sought to gain credibility in the luxury car market by collaborating with Porsche to develop the RS2 station wagon, which became a high performance car and set the standard for Audi's station wagons. Porsche was so desperate that they allowed Audi to license their name and put it on the cars.
Porsche allowed Audi to license their name and put it on cars, allowing the Porsche logo to appear on the badge, in order to keep the lights on at Stuttgart and Zuffenhausen. Despite the potential risks, Porsche was desperate enough to take the risk.
A factory tour guide revealed that Mercedes-Benz provided a project to keep Porsche's factory workers going during a difficult time, allowing them to continue producing cars.
David, Ben, and Doug discuss the need to contract manufacture in order to keep their lines going, even though it may not be profitable. They acknowledge that it was a tough era and that younger people may not understand the circumstances.
Porsche faced a period of near-extinction not long ago, but with the help of modern technology, they have been able to stay afloat and continue to produce cars.
Vanta has grown to become the best security compliance platform, with over 5000 customers, offering customization for more complex security needs. Ben and David discuss how Vanta has grown from a few hundred customers to a larger enterprise.
Vanta's new Vendor Risk Management feature allows companies to quickly understand the security posture of their vendors in a standardized way, cutting down on security review times and providing visibility into the compliance posture of vendors used in the software stack.
Vanta provides visibility into the security and compliance posture of vendors, enabling custom frameworks and real-time data to ensure compliance. A free trial is now available for the first time.
Doug, Ben, and David discuss the ability to pay for a Porsche to be painted in a color from any Porsche ever produced in history, with the example of a library wine.
Porsche has changed drastically over the years, and now commands a high price for its iconic design language and 911 model. The brand is emblematic of its obsession with making tiny tweaks and refinements to perfect its products.
erm Sales Cycle 
Porsche has been marketing to both adults and children since its inception in 1948, with the goal of hooking people young and making them feel the brand is cool. This strategy has been consistent since the brand's rise from the ashes in the 1980s.
A Tale of Two Eras - David and Doug discuss Porsche's transformation from a tailspin in 1993 to the emergence of icons and lore over the years, with the appointment of Wendelin Wiedeking as CEO in 1993 being a pivotal moment.
In 1993, Wendelin Wiedeking was appointed CEO of Porsche and implemented the Toyota Production System, which helped the company become more efficient and profitable.
Porsche CEO, likened to Tim Cook of Apple, made the bold decision to cut the product lines down to just the 911, despite analysts' questions about an entry-level Porsche strategy. He responded that the strategy was to buy a used Porsche.
Porsche's strategy for an entry level model is to use a used Porsche, as the 911 is the only model left on the market since the 356. Ben and David discuss the strategy and its implications for the company's financial performance.
Porsche CEO Peter Schutz revives the 914 concept by taking the front end of the next generation 911, the 996, and combining it with a new entry level back end. The Boxster is a full convertible with shared interiors, including the steering wheel and buttons, and even a coat hook on the back of the seat.
The Porsche Boxster is a two-seater car that has been a huge success due to its Porsche-like features and performance. It was created to be an alternative to the 911 model, and has been embraced by many.
Making the Entry Level Porsche Look Like a 911 - Porsche CEO Wiedeking's thought was to make the entry level Porsche look like a 911, sharing the same design language, fenders, headlights and hood, to make it look like a first-class citizen.
A Shared Component Model for Production and Profitability - Porsche released the Boxster in 1997, a car that was highly anticipated and featured on the cover of car magazines. It was designed to move the 911 upmarket, with more expensive and powerful components, while sharing components with itself.
Porsche has evolved from a 200 horsepower muscle car to a luxury touring car, with the Boxster and Cayman taking on the role of the true sports car.
ngine Strategy 
Ferdinand Wiedeking, CEO of Porsche, had a strategy to make Porsche a big fish in a larger lake, rather than a Ferrari in a shrinking pond. He was emboldened by the success of the Boxster and targeted big markets in a Porsche way.
Doug, Ben, and David discuss the controversial design choice of Porsche to create SUVs, with Doug noting that the design language was widely disliked when it was first released, but has since been redesigned and looks much better.
Doug and Ben discuss the redesign of the Porsche Cayenne and how it does not reflect the heritage of the Porsche 911.
Mercedes, BMW, and Porsche all revolutionized the luxury SUV market in 1998, 2000, and 2003 respectively, with Mercedes' M Class being designed for suburban families, BMW's X5 being sporty, and Porsche beating Audi to the market.
Porsche entered the SUV market early in 2003, beating Audi, but had no idea what to offer in an SUV due to their lack of experience in the market. They asked their American employees if they should offer gun racks as an option and had an optional spare tire on the back like Jeep Wranglers.
David and Doug discuss the cultural German phenomenon of the Porsche Cayenne SUV, which was the first of its kind to have an amazing on-road and off-road capability. It featured a two-speed transfer case and air suspension to make it suitable for off-roading.
nclusive Luxury Performance SUV 
Doug and David discuss the emergence of luxury SUVs in the late 1990s, with Porsche leading the way. They note that the Escalade was ahead of its time, and that wealthy people were willing to spend large amounts of money on SUVs for their practicality and status.
Porsche has successfully tapped into a new market of customers by offering SUVs, while still maintaining their brand equity and generating a high margin of profit.
Porsche has successfully increased their brand equity by doubling down on their strategy of producing SUVs and performance cars such as the Boxster and 911. This strategy has not only generated a lot of margin for the company, but has also increased the love for the brand. Volkswagen's Touareg served as the basis for the original Cayenne, and both cars were built in the same production facility.
Porsche's strategy of reinvestment in performance and creating a new factory to produce the Cayenne SUV and a supercar simultaneously, showed people that they were still dedicated to performance.
The Carrera GT is widely regarded as the greatest driving car ever built. It is a true analog supercar with a manual transmission and few driver aids, making it a unique and thrilling driving experience.
This text takes a look at an analog supercar with a manual transmission and few driver aids. It features a full carbon fiber body and a V10 powertrain that was initially developed for Formula One and Le Mans racing, but never saw the light of day. It is similar to the original 911 engine designed by Ferdinand Piech.
Ferdinand Piech's 911 engine was designed for racing, but was homologated for road use. This car was thought of as special in its era, but its legend has grown since then as sports cars have moved away from the analog field that made it so unique.
The Legend of a Special Car 
A new Audi RS3, a high performance sedan that can be bought for $65,000-$70,000, is faster than its predecessors and marks the end of an era where cars could be dangerous. Paul Walker and other people have died in these cars, and there is still potential for more accidents.
Despite a lawsuit against Porsche for their high-end car with a dangerous reputation, the value of the car has not decreased. People are still aware of the car's potential to cause serious accidents and death.
An automaker faced unexpected issues that caused them to produce more cars than initially intended, resulting in a low sale price of $440,000 that dropped to $250,000 in 2007-2008. Now, the cars are worth over a million dollars.
David and Doug discuss the missed opportunity of investing in Porsche Carrera GTs in 2007-2008, which could have been purchased for $250,000 but now cost over a million dollars.
Porsche used their brand equity to make an SUV and put cash back in the bank, while also legitimizing their East German production line. Other luxury brands, such as Louis Vuitton, also use this strategy by releasing more approachable products and collaborations with other designers to maintain their brand story.
Porsche went from a €400 million market cap when Wiedeking took over to a €32 billion market cap by 2007, without any help. This success story was due to the bold plan and new products, such as $100 000 or $200 000 special handbags, released by Louis Vuitton to show they were still part of the brand.
A discussion between Ben, David, and Doug about Porsche's incredible market cap growth of 100X in a decade, and how it is an example of a "hundred bagger" investment opportunity available in the public markets.
Doug, David, and Ben discuss the risks of investing in Porsche in 1993, when the company was on its fourth CEO and seemed to be clutching at straws. Despite the risks, they note that investing in such a situation can be profitable, as seen with Amazon in 2001-2002.
Porsche's market cap of €32 billion is not crazy due to their operating profit of €2 billion a year, and their expansion into SUVs and the Panamera sedan. China's growth has also contributed to their success.
The Panamera was the final chapter of the Wiedeking era on the production side, and was intended to target the China market. It became successful globally, and helped Porsche enter China, with its business and all luxury brands growing in Asia.
Porsche's corporate psyche shifted from a singular product to a full product suite due to the 100X growth in profits from the Boxster, Cayman, and Cayenne models.
Porsche's expansion strategy of targeting the Mercedes S class and BMW 7 series proved to be successful, however, the company ultimately changed ownership and the strategy was not the cause of the company's downfall.
Porsche's expansion strategy was too ambitious, leading to the brand crashing and ultimately being acquired by Volkswagen. The German tax regime disincentivized spinning off cash flow and incentivized reinvesting, so Porsche had to look for other places to put their money. Rumors circulated that Volkswagen had their eye on Porsche, leading to the acquisition.
Rumors of Volkswagen's interest in recruiting Porsche's CEO, Wiedeking, to be the successor to Ferdinand Piech, circulated in the auto industry. Ben and David discuss the possibility of this being true, as Piech is nearing the end of his career. Wiedeking is feeling confident in his position at Porsche.
CEO of Porsche, Wendieking, has an ambitious plan to buy Volkswagen and become the CEO of the Volkswagen Group, despite Ferdinand Piech being the chairman and CEO of Volkswagen Group and a key member of the family that owns Porsche.
iech Family Drama 
In September 2005, Porsche spent $4 billion to acquire 20% of the VW Group on the open market, deepening the partnership between the two companies. Porsche's CEO and CFO joined the Volkswagen board and kept buying shares, using a patented Bernard Arnault technique.
Porsche's CFO joins the Volkswagen board and uses derivatives and options contracts to buy the rights to buy shares in the future, circumventing the Volkswagen Law which was designed to prevent a takeover.
The Volkswagen Law was created to protect the Volkswagen Group from corporate takeovers, by limiting the voting rights of any shareholder to no more than 20%. In 2005, Porsche acquired an 18.53% stake in the Volkswagen Group, and increased it to more than 25% in 2006.
Porsche SE Holding was created in 2007 as a publicly-traded holding company for the family's ownership of Porsche, with a 53% stake in the business. Porsche increased their ownership to more than 25% in July 2006, and Wiedeking loaded up the holding company with $10 billion of debt to buy more VW shares on the market.
Ferdinand Piech signs off on Wiedeking's plan to buy VW shares with $10 billion of debt, ultimately leading to Porsche owning more than 50% of the float of VW shares.
Porsche has acquired more than 50% of Volkswagen shares, leaving only 30% left on the open market. This has caused the market cap of Volkswagen to rise, briefly making it the most valuable company in the world.
After Lehman Brothers collapsed in October 2008, Volkswagen Group became the most valuable company in the world due to a short squeeze caused by hedge funds shorting the stock.
Hedge funds have been shorting, leading to a short squeeze and a surge in stock value. This is great for Porsche and Wiedeking, who own more than 50% of the most valuable company in the world, but they have a large debt that they cannot refinance due to Lehman's collapse.
Porsche and Wiedeking are in a difficult situation due to their debt, as Lehman's collapse has made it impossible to refinance. VW shares are artificially high due to a short squeeze, and Porsche cannot sell their shares to service the debt without the share price crashing. They are unable to take out any more debt, leaving them stuck in a state of stasis.
Ferdinand Piech, former CEO of Porsche and current chairman of the VW board, has not made any moves in the automotive industry since the Lehman Brothers collapse. He is stuck in a state of stasis, unable to sell shares or make any other changes.
Ferdinand Piech, former CEO of Volkswagen, publicly declared that Porsche was no longer a financially viable entity, leading to Volkswagen offering to purchase Porsche's operating company for €3
Porsche's key partner went into debt buying Porsche's shares, leading to insolvency and default on loans. Porsche floated a price of €3
In 2009, Porsche CEO Wendieking left the company to a standing ovation from employees, having saved the company from financial ruin. Volkswagen then purchased Porsche in two tranches over three years, with the total cost being €8½ billion. The Porsche
The Porsche-Piech families created a holding company, Porsche SE, which bought 50% of VW Group. VW Group then paid €8½ billion to buy Porsche, making the families one of the top 15 wealthiest in the world, owning 32% of VW Group and Porsche.
Porsche AG is owned by Volkswagen Group, but the Porsche family has over 50% of the voting power and recently received an €8½ billion cash out.
Porsche's sales have been consistently strong, with only one down year during the financial crisis, and the introduction of the 918 Spyder helped to introduce plug
Porsche's 918 supercar was used to introduce plug-in hybrid technology, showing that hybrids can be more than just the "cheap, little car" of the Prius. Ben and Doug discuss how Porsche does not always make supercars.
Supercars are a rare and special occurrence, made only once every 10-15 years to prove a technology or concept. They have a short model run, with the 918 only producing 918 units and the 959 producing 1270.
A Supercar Rarity - The Porsche 918 Spyder is a highly sought-after supercar, with only 918 units produced and a current price tag of $2 million. Its rivals, the McLaren P1 and LaFerrari, did not combine to make as many units.
Porsche's 918 Spyder was a plug-in hybrid supercar that cost 40% more than the base price of $900,000. It was Porsche's way of entering the plug-in hybrid world in anticipation of the rise of hybrids and electric cars.
Porsche's transition to electric supercars was met with mixed reactions, as the 918 Spyder, LaFerrari, and McLaren P1 all had powerful engines. However, the next crop of supercars will likely be fully electric, which may be more controversial.
The next generation of supercars will be electric, and Porsche is leading the charge. Ferrari, however, is not on board, and this could lead to a situation where owners of these cars are left with no options if the battery fails.
Porsche and Ferrari have committed to standing behind their cars to preserve resale value and ensure owners of their supercars are protected. This commitment is not easy, but it is a smart brand decision to ensure the success of their future models.
Ferrari is a small operation that produces 13,000 cars a year. It was once owned by Enzo Ferrari, who drove the company into financial doom due to his pursuit of racing. Fiat Group eventually stepped in to save the company. The rule of luxury is to dominate the customer.
Porsche joining the Volkswagen Group allowed them to spread out their fuel economy standards and meet certain targets, while also allowing them to benefit from the other cars being inefficient.
Different Options - Waseem Daher, CEO of Pilot.com, explains that there is no right way to fund a company and that people should not fetishize venture capital-backed startups.
People often fetishize venture capital and venture capital-backed startups, but this is misguided. Raising VC is not a reflection of self-worth or an indication of the quality of a business. Success is determined by providing a service that people love and are willing to pay for, and growing at a rate that is exciting.
Ben and David discuss the importance of discipline in business, and how the goal of business is to have the highest net present value of all future cash flows, regardless of the timing of venture capital.
Venture capital can be a great opportunity for some companies, but it can also close doors for others. Waseem and Ben discuss how their first startup was bootstrapped and exited at a value that would have been uninteresting to venture capital investors, but was life-changing for them. David mentions how Pilot is powering the accounting and bookkeeping of large companies such as OpenAI, Airtable, and Scale.
Pilot is providing 20% off finance, accounting, and tax prep services for the first six months to OpenAI Airtable Scale. The VW Group has also released the Macan, a mini compact SUV, and the Cayenne, a midsize SUV, with engines shared across many model lines.
Volkswagen owns many brands, such as Porsche, Lamborghini, Bentley, Audi, and more. To save costs, they have begun to share engines across all of these model lines, which is a departure from Porsche's traditional engineering culture.
Porsche was one of the first companies to introduce the concept of electric vehicles with the Mission E concept in 2015, before the Tesla Model S was released in 2012. Despite some initial skepticism, the Macan and Taycan have been a big hit, and even entire nations have been slow to adopt electric vehicles.
Japan is five years behind the rest of the world in the electric vehicle market, despite being the inventors of the hybrid car. Toyota only recently released their first electric car, leaving many to question why Japan was so slow to enter the market.
Porsche was the forefront of hybrids, and the Taycan sedan was released and well
David and Doug discuss Porsche's decision to release an electric sedan in 2015, questioning if it was a mistake due to the current trend of electric SUVs. David believes Porsche is well-positioned for an electric future.
Porsche is well-positioned for an electric future, with an electric Macan coming soon and plans for electric versions of all their cars.
The future of cars is electric, with the Taycan being the first all-electric supercar. It can accelerate incredibly well, reaching 0-60 in 2 seconds, faster than any other car.
The Porsche Taycan is a four-door car that can do 0-60 in 2 seconds, and is tuned to drive like a track car. Porsche is likely to come out with a supercar in the next couple of years that will be limited to a thousand units, cost $2 million, and have a 0-60 time of 1.5 seconds.
The next generation of supercars will be limited to a thousand units, cost $2 million, and be fully electric with the capability of 0–60 in 1½ seconds. Doug believes that this will help the values of these cars increase, as they will be faster than modern standards and have other unique features such as feel and sound.
This text discusses the Kia EV6 GT, a high performance electric crossover that can do 0-60 in 3.2 seconds, faster than a Carrera GT. It questions what a supercar means in the modern age, and suggests that the Kia EV6 GT offers many of the same features as a supercar, such as lower and wider design for better handling, at a much lower cost.
Porsche's re-IPO in September 2022 was the largest European IPO of all time, with an initial market cap of $75 billion. The discussion also touched on the democratization of power, with electric cars now able to reach 0-60 in 3 seconds, and how this will affect the future of sports cars.
Porsche's initial market cap of $75 billion has grown to $115 billion in the 9 months since its re-IPO, unlocking value for shareholders and allowing them to own a premier luxury company without commingling it with other investments.
David, Doug, and Ben discuss the difficulty of extricating companies and platforms financially, and how value is unlocked by marketing a security rather than creating value inside the company. Karl Ludvigsen's book, Excellence Was Expected, is also mentioned.
Karl Ludvigsen recently published a new edition of his book, "Excellence Was Expected", reflecting on the transformation of Porsche from an independent company to one owned by Volkswagen. He also mentions that investors can buy Porsche AG or Porsche SE, the family's holding company, on the stock market.
A Tale of Two Companies - Ben and David discuss the differences between Porsche AG and Porsche SE, two companies that are both controlled by the Porsche family, and how they are intertwined.
Porsche's business model is based on two
Porsche's sports car sales are slow, but the Panamera has decent sales. China is Porsche's largest market at 26%, followed by Germany at 10% and the rest of Europe at 23%.
Doug and Ben discuss the popularity of Porsche in Europe and China, noting that the Chinese only buy four-door cars due to a lack of heritage Porsche in the country.
Ben and Doug discuss the success of Porsche SUVs in North America and the rest of the world, with 24% of sales coming from North America and 16% from the rest of the world. Porsche delivered 80,000 cars in the last quarter, with a 20% year-over-year growth.
Tesla has grown to a scale organization, delivering 350,000 cars last year, with an average selling price of $110,000. Comparisons have been made to Rolex in terms of brand perception, but from an operational standpoint, the company is more like Louis Vuitton.
Louis Vuitton and Hermes are two luxury brands that have tiered access to luxury products, with a shared brand that unifies them. Louis Vuitton has been able to make a lot of products, while Hermes has been able to maintain its high-end brand perception. Porsche is seen as the equivalent of Louis Vuitton, while Ferrari is seen as the equivalent of Hermes.
Despite the availability of Porsche vehicles for a relatively low cost, the brand still maintains a higher status than other luxury car brands due to its hoity
Doug and Ben discuss the inverse relationship between scale and brand perception, and how BMW has managed to make a lot of SUVs while still maintaining their brand. They also discuss the average selling price of a Ferrari.
Ben and Doug discuss the differences between Ferrari and Porsche, including the average selling price of a Ferrari ($330,000) and the number of Ferraris made each year (13,000) compared to Porsches (350,000). They also discuss the enthusiast world's preference for one over the other.
Doug, Ben, and David discuss Porsche's aggregate market cap and the Carrera GT, with Ferrari's average selling price being $330,000. Doug has not yet purchased a Porsche SUV, but he recommends them to many people.
A man explains why he and his wife have not purchased a Porsche SUV, despite his friends owning one; his wife does not want to be seen in a Porsche, and the man does not want to drive a car of that name brand on a daily basis.
Doug and Ben discuss the pros and cons of driving a Porsche, with Doug noting that having a Porsche SUV is more "in your face" than a sports car, while Ben compares it to having the Masters logo embroidered on golf clubs.
Ben and Doug discuss the differences between the Mazda CX-5 and the Tesla Model 3, with Doug noting that the CX-5 is the "Japanese Porsche Macan" of the mainstream. Ben reveals that he drives a Mazda CX-5, while David drives a Tesla Model 3.
A Look at Profiles and Gross Margin - Doug and Ben discuss the Porsche Macan and its gross margin, comparing it to BMW and other brands. They also discuss the profiles of the businesses and how gross margin can be used to understand the strength of a brand.
Ben and Doug discuss the gross margins of BMW, Porsche, Mercedes, and Ferrari, with Ferrari having the highest gross margin of 48%. They also note the average price of a Ferrari is $330,000, and that 13,000 cars are sold each year.
Ferrari charges $2000 for Apple CarPlay and $800 for heated seats, while LVMH's gross margin is 68%. Ben explains that cars have hard costs that other luxury goods don't, so Ferrari can't just make every car cost $8 million.
Luxury goods such as leather can be marked up more than luxury cars, due to the hard costs associated with cars. LVMH has the opportunity to generate high price premiums for their goods, and it is speculated that this is why they have not made a run at luxury auto companies.
Automotive businesses require a special type of person and team to run them, as they involve engineering and art. Distribution is harder and scalability is more difficult than other businesses owned by LVMH. Bernard Arnault has likely explored licensing agreements with Ferrari and Lamborghini, but owning these businesses is not as feasible.
Discussion of the challenges of owning a car factory, including R&D, scalability, distribution, and pricing power. Analysis of Porsche's gross margins compared to BMW and Mercedes, and Ferrari's inability to produce the same number of cars as Porsche while maintaining their margins.
Porsche is able to maintain luxury brand status while producing more cars than Ferrari and 10 times more than BMW, due to scale economies enabled by being part of the Volkswagen Group.
Ben and David discuss how scale economies enable car brands to enter the SUV business, and how the heritage and brand of a car company can be a differentiating factor against competitors. Doug adds that German engineering also plays a role in the success of certain car brands.
Doug and David discuss the reputation of German engineering and its impact on the reliability of Porsche cars compared to other luxury car manufacturers.
Porsche's reliability is supposedly still excellent according to JD Power studies, but it is uncertain how much this matters to customers when making decisions about cars. There is a specialness to Porsche cars that is not found in other brands, which may be more important to customers.
Ben and David discuss the difficulty of competing with luxury brands that have a long-standing heritage, as it is impossible to manufacture or replicate the same level of history and trust.
Ben and David discuss the potential for a heritage brand to emerge from the 2020s, with Doug agreeing that it will take many decades for this to happen, but that it will have to be for something other than racing.
Doug, David, and Ben discuss the importance of brand and performance in the automotive industry, referencing the 25
Iconic Brand Advertising and Counter Positioning - Discussion of two iconic Porsche ads, "Kills Bugs Fast" and "Nobody's Perfect", and how they used counter positioning to stand out from other high-end car brands.
This text looks back on the famous Porsche advertising campaigns, with David, Ben, and Doug discussing their favorite ad, "Kills Bugs Fast" and "Nobody's Perfect". The latter ad featured the top 10 winners at Le Mans, with Porsche having 9 of the 10.
Porsche has 9 of the 10 cars in the industry, and Doug and Ben discuss the lack of switching costs in the car industry, as well as the differences between Apple and car tech.
German engineering is discussed in relation to the automotive industry, with the conclusion that there is no cornered resource in the industry.
Porsche has invested billions in racing over the years, which adds to the brand value and is worth investing in. This is an example of an adjacent activity to the core business of the company that can be beneficial.
Companies such as Porsche and Nike have invested billions in racing and marketing budgets to build their brand prestige and fulfill customer dreams.
Porsche provides fan service to customers to ensure brand continuity and long-term success, using tactics such as providing opportunities for customers to feel the same way about the brand today as they did in the past, and delivering fan service moments in their products. This strategy has a 40-50 year sales cycle.
David and Doug discuss the 40-50 year sales cycle of owning a Porsche, and how it is a dream for many children, even though it is the same as owning an SUV.
The Coolest Freaking Thing - Doug DeMuro and his colleagues discuss the appeal of working for Porsche, despite the low pay, due to the prestige and the opportunity to drive a 911.
Ben and David discuss criteria for evaluating Porsche as a stock, including revenue growth, profitability, and defensibility. They also consider entry price when evaluating the stock.
David evaluates Porsche's prospects for revenue growth in the future, noting that they are well-positioned in the EV market and have impressive growth at their current scale. He believes that as they electrify their lineup, there is a strong bull case for revenue growth.
Porsche's revenue growth potential is strong due to their electrification of their lineup, and they are expected to fare better than Mercedes and BMW in a downturn, but worse than Ferrari. Cash-sensitive buyers are a major factor in their success.
Porsche is well-positioned in a recession due to their cash-sensitive buyers, SUVs, and ability to charge for colors and options. Ferrari is in a league of its own, while BMW, Mercedes, Tesla, Ford, and Chevy are also in the broader universe.
Porsche has perfected their options for customers, leading to a subculture of specking cars in the perfect way. This has resulted in a strong profitability for the automotive industry, although not as strong as the technology industry or Apple.
Porsche has a 29% gross margin and operating margins in the high teens to low 20s, which is a nine for the auto industry and a four compared to most businesses studied on Acquired.
David and Doug discuss the profitability of the auto industry, with Ben adding that five is the highest score one can give in the auto industry. Doug then mentions Ferrari, which Ben adds is almost not in the auto industry, as it is a completely different luxury category.
Ben and Doug discuss the profitability and defensibility of Porsche, noting that customer love and brand value have increased significantly since Ben worked there. They believe that Porsche will not be seen as a BMW in 10 years.
Porsche has become increasingly popular over the last 10 years, with vintage models shooting up in value and Cars & Coffee events becoming de facto Porsche events. Despite not having the same brand equity as Ferrari, Porsche has become more beloved than ever before.
Porsche has achieved success in the automotive industry by being able to produce both SUVs and supercars, allowing them to be mentioned in the same breath as Ferrari. Despite not having the same brand equity as Ferrari, Porsche has been able to execute their strategy well and become an everyday supercar company.
Porsche has gone from making the 911 the everyday supercar to now having a whole gradient of everyday supercars that are still growing in popularity, even as their model line expands. This is evidenced by the fact that, according to the LVMH episode, Porsche is so powerful that nothing could completely kill it.
Despite attempts to kill the brand, Porsche's heritage and value remain intact, suggesting that it is impossible to completely eradicate the brand.
David and Doug discuss the power of the Porsche brand and Doug's highest score ever, which is in the range of 72-74.
Ben introduces David and Doug to Resortpass.com, a website that offers Airbnb-style amenities at resorts. He explains that he and his wife typically book a condo or Airbnb when they go on vacation, as they are usually right next to fancy hotels.
ResortPass is a platform that allows people to access luxury hotel amenities such as day beds, cabanas, and pools for a fee. David and his wife Jenny have been using this platform to access these amenities without having to book a hotel room.
David and Jenny have been using a platform to book hotel stays and spa massages, and Ben introduces David to a new platform called ResortPass. David also mentions his habit of going down YouTube rabbit holes, which is how he found Ben.
Four members of the Seinfeld cast, Jason Alexander, David, Doug, and Charlie Rose, discuss the differences between their characters and their real-life personalities. Jason Alexander is noted to be the best interviewer of the four, and Doug remarks that he is "pretty legit" when seen interviewed or speaking extemporaneously.
David, Doug, and Ben discuss how Jason Alexander's character on Curb Your Enthusiasm is different from George, and how Larry David takes it personally. They also mention that Larry David is featured in a compilation of Charlie Rose conversations, and Doug mentions a YouTuber named WhistlinDiesel.
Doug introduces his friends to WhistlinDiesel, a car YouTuber from Tennessee who does crazy stunts such as putting a Tesla on 20 foot tall wagon wheels and putting a Ferrari in a bubble and throwing objects at it.
